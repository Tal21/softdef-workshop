### DISCOS:
- There is a class in the CSS called `sticky-top` that essentially forces the feature encompassed in that class to always remain on the page regardless of whether you scroll up and down.
- A `sticky-top` is good way to add headers and a `sticky-bottom` is a good way to make a footer.
- Bootstrap has built in containers, you can change the style of the container:
  - The background
  - The Size
  - The Position
- 


### Q/C/C:
- I wonder if you make enough items sticky, can you have a whole secret website behind the sticky aspects.
